# Problem Statement
You are given a string 
$S$ of length 
$N$, consisting of 0 and 1. Let 
$S_i$ 
denote the 
i-th character of 
S.

Process 
Q queries in the order they are given.
Each query is represented by a tuple of three integers 
(c,L,R), where 
c represents the type of the query.

When $c=1$: For each integer 
$i$ such that 
$L\leq i\leq R$, if 
$S_i$ is $1$, change it to $0$; if it is $0$, change it to $1$.

When 
$c=2$: Let 
$T$ be the string obtained by extracting the 
$L$-th through 
$R$-th characters of 
$S$. Print the maximum number of consecutive $1$ s in 
$T$.

# Constraints

$1≤N≤5×10^5$
 
$1≤Q≤10^5$
 
$S$ is a string of length 
$N$ consisting of $0$ and $1$.

c∈{1,2}

1≤L≤R≤N

N, 
Q, 
c, 
L, and 
R are all integers.

# Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format, where 
query 
i
​
  represents the 
i-th query:

```
N Q
S
query 1
query 2
​⋮
query Q
```
​
 
Each query is given in the following format:
```
c L R
```
# Output
Let 
$k$ be the number of queries with 
$c=2$. Print $k$ lines.

The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query with $c=2$.
