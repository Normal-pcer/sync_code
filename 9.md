# B3983 [ Information and the Future ] AI Robot

## Description
There is a robot in a rectangle space with rows and columns. Each block in the space is either flat (express as `.`) or barrier (express as `#`). There is an example above where $n=3, m=7$:
```
...#...
...#...
.......
```
Initial, the robot is at left top corner of the rectangle. At each moment, the robot is able to execute command `U`(up), `L`(left), `D`(down) or `R`(right) following the program, try to move for one block to target direction. Specially, if the target block is out of the border or a barrier, it will keep static. For example, after executing program:
`LLLRRRRRRRRRDDDDRRRRRRRRR`
, the robot will move from the left-top to the right-bottom. Dr.X extended expression ability with importing "loop". With a given program `P`, `P(n)` is same as "copy and paste" `P` for n times. A nesting loop is also allowed. For example, executing program in an infinite flat space:
`(R(DRUL)7)5`
